## Information economies

![](images/hand.jpg)

Prediction markets are poised to become one of the most disruptive innovations in capital markets
and data science since the beginning of the Information Revolution. First proposed in the early 90s,
prediction markets have yet to attract mass attention in the realm of forecasting and decision-making
despite their documented efficacy for information aggregation. This is largely due to over-regulation
in many of the world’s leading financial sectors.

With the invention of powerful, peer-to-peer computing technologies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, the scientific exploration of market-based forecasting can proceed uninhibited and at a rate and scale previously unimaginable. Our team believes undoubtedly that prediction markets will disrupt some of the largest existing industries in the near term. Looking forward, we expect that the Gnosis prediction market platform will form the basis for machine information economies on a global scale.

In order for a prediction market platform to become truly disruptive, it must be universal and
draw from a global liquidity pool. The platform must be decentralized, permissionless, and trustless
for such a liquidity pool to exist. With these requirements in mind, the Gnosis team has selected the
Ethereum network as the core protocol upon which the platform will be built.

#### Problem Overview

Generally speaking, the Information Revolution has made it easier for individuals to quickly retrieve
data about any topic. Despite the ease of access we enjoy today, this form of information aggregation
still requires a great deal of coordination to be effective. More often than not, the data is severely
lacking in context and objectivity and requires heavier lifting to produce actionable information
for use in decision-making processes. The reason for this is straightforward: written information
is inextricably linked to the writer’s individual biases and agenda, making it difficult to delineate
useful information from opinions or intentional misinformation. In other words, it’s easy to find
what people have said but hard to ascertain what they actually believe.

Financial markets are particularly interesting in this regard in that the act of speculation elicits a
highly effective form of information aggregation that requires no coordination (i.e. the “invisible
hand”) and more closely mirrors individual beliefs. Principally, market speculators who believe they have superior information buy shares when they believe a company is undervalued and sell shares
when they believe the company is overvalued. A monetary incentive exists to “update” a common
data point (i.e. share price) when there is profit potential, and there is a disincentive to misreport in
the form of financial loss. The resulting equilibrium share price reflects the prevailing market-wide
sentiment about a company’s value at any given time. In summary, information aggregation occurs
with *skin in the game* - a characteristic that:

1. effectively glues an individual’s action to their privately held beliefs and
2. is absent from other methods for information aggregation such as polling.

This is vital for understanding the principal function of prediction markets.

A prediction market, in essence, is a vehicle for aggregating information about the expected
outcome of a future event. Unlike a traditional financial market, prediction markets frame themselves
as questions about the future, typically with binary outcomes. For example: Which presidential
candidate will win the 2016 election? Shares are divided among pre-defined options (e.g. Hillary
Clinton, Donald Trump, Other) with corresponding share prices equaling $1. Each option’s share
price reflects its probability of occurrence. So long as an individual believes they have superior
information about the event in question, s/he has an incentive to purchase shares that reflect his/her
beliefs about the outcome, thereby updating information captured by the prediction market. At the
market’s conclusion, the winning option’s shares become redeemable for $1, while all other shares
become worthless. Individual actors who purchased the winning shares receive profit equal to $1 -
purchase price x number of shares.

#### Core Objectives

##### Build the World’s Most Efficient Forecasting Tool

Prediction markets can enable a more efficient and informed world. Prediction markets and oracles
will bridge real world events to the blockchain, thereby strengthening its value as an authoritative
source of truth about the world.

##### Create the “Google” of Customized Information Searching

Gnosis enables anyone to ask a question and fund the search for answers. This creates new economic
opportunities for subject matter experts and more efficient avenues for crowdsourcing and aggregating
information. The power of “search” is decentralized and inclusive.

##### Become the Standard for Predictive Assets

Gnosis seeks to establish a global, open prediction market platform with a single liquidity pool.
This limitless resource enables the simple creation of custom prediction market applications and
embodies a flexible marketplace for blockchain oracle services.

## Crowdsourced wisdom?

On top of the Services layer (or in some cases, just Gnosis Core) is the Gnosis application layer.
These applications are primarily front-ends that target a particular prediction market use case and or
customer segment. Some of these applications may be built by Gnosis, while others will be built by
third parties. Our vision for Gnosis is to have a wide variety of prediction market applications built
atop the same platform and liquidity pool. These applications will likely charge additional fees or
use alternative business models such as market making, information selling, or advertising. As we’ll
see in the next section on tokens, many Gnosis applications may include token holding as a core
component of their business model.

> The platform must be decentralized, permissionless, and trustless for such a liquidity pool to exist. With these requirements in mind, the Gnosis team has selected the Ethereum network as the core protocol upon which the platform will be built.

State channels are a prerequisite for betting and financial applications requiring thousands or
more transactions per second. Without stablecoins, market participants are subject to the volatility
of the cryptocurrency which the market is denominated in and the event outcome that they are
predicting. Application templates, customization tools, and advanced oracle selection will allow us
to execute on our vision of lowering the barrier to entry for new prediction market based applications
by at least two orders of magnitude. While some applications and participants will interact with
Gnosis on the Core level, we are confident that these services will provide a compelling reason for
Services level use.

## Jekyll Themes

The Core layer provides the foundational smart contracts for Gnosis use: event token creation and
settlement, a market mechanism, oracle, and a management interface. This layer is and always will
be free and open to use. Creating new markets is near zero marginal cost, and to remain competitive
fees will have to approach zero. Instead of grasping at the maximum possible fees while remaining
competitive, we feel that it is prudent to eliminate fees at the most basic contract level. It should be in every party’s best interest to use the existing open source and feeless contracts instead of deploying
their own version.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/neura-pro/neura-pro.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
